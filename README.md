# Caring for the Environment through Technology 
> "Nature is not a place to visit. It is home." - Gary Snyder

This quote by Gary Snyder highlights the importance of nature and our connection to it. It also inspired us to work on this project, which aims to help people care for their plants. By taking care of our plants, we can create a healthier and more beautiful environment around us. This project encourages us to appreciate nature and take steps to protect and preserve it.

## Project Objective

As part of the CE71 Project Computer Systems Engineering module, we developed a small system with a Raspberry Pi at the forefront that monitors the soil moisture of the plant and, if necessary, waters the plant. Additionally, the system captures the growth of the plant with a camera, which creates a time-lapse at the end. There is also a light sensor to avoid taking photos in darkness and an extra temperature sensor. The entire system is controlled through a web interface. The goal of the project is to learn task distribution, documentation, and time management of such a project using Gitlab.
